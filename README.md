# Recommendation-system

## Task 4: Simple Recommendation System

This project implements a **basic recommendation system** that suggests items to users based on their preferences. The system can recommend **movies, books, or products** using techniques such as **content-based filtering** or **collaborative filtering**.

The project helps in understanding the core concepts behind modern recommendation engines used by platforms like Netflix, Amazon, and Spotify.

## 🔹 Technologies Used

- Programming Language: **Python**  
- Libraries:
  - NumPy  
  - Pandas  
  - Scikit-learn  
- Concepts:
  - Recommendation Engines  
  - Similarity Measures (Cosine Similarity)  
  - User-Item Matrix

## 🔹 Recommendation Techniques

### 1️⃣ Content-Based Filtering
- Recommends items similar to those the user liked in the past
- Uses item features (genre, category, keywords)

### 2️⃣ Collaborative Filtering
- Recommends items based on preferences of similar users
- Uses user-item interaction history

## 🔹 How It Works

1. Collect user preferences or ratings
2. Build a recommendation model
3. Compute similarity between users/items
4. Generate ranked recommendations
5. Display top suggestions to the user
